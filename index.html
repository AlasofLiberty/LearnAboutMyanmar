            <p>The Myanmar Civil War is an ongoing conflict that has been in the making for decades with opposing forces fighting to overthrow the military. Myanmar is home to over 135 different ethnic groups, which were previously all ruled by an aggresive military regime. In 2011 however, the country recieved it's first glimpse of democracy by having it's militaristic government agreeing to share power in the form of elections. They hold elections in 2015 and would end in a victory by a party called the National League for Democracy would win. When they would win again in elections held in 2020 however, the military would coup the government and took back power in 2021. </p>

In 1948 the country became a sovereign republic following many years of conflict with Japanese and Indian agents. The country now however faced difficulty in addressing the needs for over 100 different ethnic groups. </p>
